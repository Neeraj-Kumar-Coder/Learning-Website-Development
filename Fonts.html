    <p id="intro">Hi my name is NEERAJ KUMAR and I am the creater of this website.</p>
    <p id="mainPara">This website is created to test fonts applied through CSS. This is basically a paragraph</p>
    <p id="aboutMe">I am Neeraj Kumar. I am 20 years old and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
        with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) from the Netaji Subhas University of Technology. I had
        finished my schooling at Evergreen Public School and currently living with my nuclear family in Delhi.
        I have many hobbies like sketching, doing origami, playing outdoor games, etc., but now I get little or no time
        to do all these activities, although I still love to do them. I love to try new things and want to learn more
        and more. I am a little impatient that sometimes results in anxiety, although I tried not to, but that didn't
        work for me.
        I had not planned much about my future because experience had shown me that didn't work. Presently I am trying
        to learn as much as possible during my four years of Engineering journey that will help me in developing my
        personal and technical skills. This is all that I have thought for myself.
        I love myself, my family, and my country very much and want to make them proud.
